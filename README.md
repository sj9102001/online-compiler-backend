## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL for flexible data storage)
- **Code Execution Sandbox:** Docker with Dockerode for isolated code execution
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for file operations, user authentication, and code execution

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The application uses a **client-server architecture** with the frontend built on **Next.js** for a seamless user experience, and a **Node.js** server to handle user requests, authentication, and code execution.

### Application Flow:
1. **User Authentication** - Register, login, and manage sessions.
2. **File Operations** - Create, view, edit, delete, and organize files and folders.
3. **Code Execution** - Securely execute user-submitted code using Docker in isolated environments.

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed
- **Docker** installed for code execution

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/online-coding-compiler.git
   cd online-coding-compiler
2. Install the dependencies.
	```bash
	npm install
3. Setting up Docker.
The code execution is handled within Docker containers. To build and run containers
The following docker images have been used to provide runtime for multiple languages
| Language | Docker Image | Description |
|--|--|--|
| Node.js | node:14 | Provides Node.js runtime environment for JavaScript code execution.|
|Python| python:3.9.18-alpine3.18|Provides Python runtime environment for Python code execution.|
4. Run the server.
	```bash
	npm start
